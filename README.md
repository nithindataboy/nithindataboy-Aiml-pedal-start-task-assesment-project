Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of image generation, preprocessing, and model inference using a deep learning model. The code includes Python scripts for preprocessing images and performing forward passes on the model, as well as Flux (Julia) scripts to run model inference in the Julia programming environment.

Instructions for Setting Up Your Environment
Prerequisites

Required Python Libraries:
torch (for PyTorch)
torchvision
matplotlib
PIL (for image handling)
numpy
To install the necessary Python libraries, run the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib pillow numpy
Note: If you are running on a GPU, make sure that you install the appropriate version of torch with CUDA support. Follow the instructions on the PyTorch official website.
2. Julia Setup

Flux.jl for deep learning
To install Flux and other necessary libraries in Julia, run:

julia
Copy
Edit
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Flux")
Pkg.add("Images")
Pkg.add("FileIO")
3. Cloning the Repository
Clone the project repository from GitHub or download the compressed folder containing the code and resources.

bash

Edit
git clone <repository_url>
Approach for Each Part of the Task
1. Image Generation and Preprocessing (Python)
Image Generation: The Python script generates synthetic images or loads real images and prepares them for the inference model.
Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and adjusted to the required format for model input. These transformations ensure that the images match the input shape expected by the model.
Main Python File: image_generation_and_model_inference.ipynb

Loads images, resizes them to 32x32 pixels.
Converts the images into a tensor format compatible with PyTorch.
Normalizes the pixel values to a range of 0-1.
Performs a forward pass through the model to generate predictions.
2. Model Inference (Flux - Julia)
Model Inference: The Flux script loads the pre-trained model (stored as a .bson file) and runs the images through the model to generate predictions.
The images are processed in a way that matches the input shape the model was trained on.
The output is generated and can be used to make predictions about the input images.
Main Julia File: model_inference.jl

Loads a pre-trained model from a BSON file.
Reads and preprocesses the image (resizing and normalizing).
Runs inference by performing a forward pass with the preprocessed image.
Outputs the predicted values (e.g., classifications, predictions).
Challenges Encountered
Integration of Python and Julia: Combining Python and Julia scripts in the same project was challenging, as the workflows and environments are different. I had to ensure the input data was compatible with both frameworks for inference.

Image Preprocessing Consistency: Ensuring that image preprocessing steps (like resizing, normalization) are consistent between Python (PyTorch) and Julia (Flux) was tricky. Any mismatch in preprocessing steps can lead to inconsistent predictions.

Model Loading: Handling the loading of pre-trained models and ensuring the same architecture was replicated in both Python (PyTorch) and Julia (Flux) caused some confusion. The model weights needed to be saved in a transferable format between both frameworks.

Assumptions Made
Model Format: I assumed that the pre-trained model in PyTorch (Python) could be saved and transferred for inference in Julia using a format that Flux can read (BSON in this case).
Image Size: I assumed that the model was trained on 32x32 images, so the preprocessing step involved resizing all images to 32x32 pixels. If the model was trained on a different image size, this would need to be adjusted.
Pretrained Model Availability: The model was already trained, so the task focused only on inference and not on training the model from scratch.
Image Quality: I assumed that the input images were of good quality and suitable for the model to handle without needing advanced image cleaning or augmentation techniques.

How to Run the Project
Python Notebook
Open image_generation_and_model_inference.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run the notebook cells sequentially.
The notebook will:
Generate or load images.
Preprocess the images.
Pass the images through the model and print the output.
Flux (Julia) Script
Open the model_inference.jl script in your Julia environment.
Run the script to perform inference on a preprocessed image.
Ensure that the model file (trained_model.bson) is available and paths to images are correctly specified.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of performing image generation, preprocessing, and model inference. By using both Python (for preprocessing and image generation) and Julia (for model inference using Flux), this project combines the power of two languages to demonstrate a deep learning workflow.
